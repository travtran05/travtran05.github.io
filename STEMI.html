	<p>Description: This course focuses on scientific research and
		engineering. During the first part of the year, students conduct
		independent research projects that incorporate reviewing literature,
		making conjectures, developing methodology, designing experiments, and
		communicating findings. Their final projects are presented at a
		school-wide science fair, with the possibility for advancement to
		regional, state, and international fairs. During the second part of
		the year, students work in small teams in order to engineer new
		products – usually assistive technology devices. They meet with
		clients, conduct patent searches, design and build prototypes,
		demonstrate their products to expert judges, and deliver the products
		to their clients. Throughout the course, students practice
		incorporating purpose, clarity, organization, mechanics, and audience
		appeal as they communicate about topics in science and technology.
		Assignments consist of research papers, short essays, technical
		reports, and presentations. Students participate actively, as both
		writers and self-editors, and their works are consistently revised and
		often submitted for publication in online and print journals.</p>

	<h4 class="center">Development of a Modular Below-Elbow Prosthesis
		with Bidirectional Signaling for Children</h4>
	<p>My project designed a modular prosthetic arm for children via 3D
		printing. The goal of my project was to reduce the cost of prostheses
		for children by creating a modular prototype which reduces the number
		of prostheses need during childhood. In addition to modularity, other
		focusing points of the project were: functionality, durability,
		comfort, and cost-effectiveness. The final product proved to be
		successful in testing.</p>

			Today, many prosthetic options are too expensive for the majority of
			individuals to obtain, causing a lowered quality of life for millions
			of amputees around the world. For children with a limb difference, it
			is even harder to obtain functional prostheses, as the child outgrows
			the limb too quickly, thus, new prostheses are needed every 12-18
			months. In order to combat the price barrier surrounding advanced
			prostheses, a modular myoelectric prosthesis model was created. The
			movement control of the myoelectric was implemented through an
			Arduino-microcontroller and powered by servo motors and photoelectric
			sensors by way of electrical signals emitted from muscles. The
			modular prototypes were developed with many different 3D-printed
			materials, infill levels, Arduino code, and movement mechanic
			designs, then tested on five specific criteria: functionality,
			modularity, durability, comfort, and cost effectiveness. Due to its
			modularity, the prosthesis will be more accessible to children who
			cannot afford to buy new ones. Additionally, bidirectional signaling
			between the prosthesis and the user was a major focus of this project
			so that the user would be able to feel simple sensations with the
			prosthesis. A cheaper, 3D-printed, and modular below-elbow
			myoelectric prosthesis will allow children to grow up with and
			utilize prostheses to a greater extent. The best prototype according
			to the criteria was selected via an engineering design matrix.
			Testing showed that the prototype performed at 42% the functionality
			of a human arm. Future work will be geared toward implementing
			permanent electrode sensors and continuing to improve upon the
			criteria. <br> <br> Keywords: <i>sensory feedback, 3D

		<p class="flex-item overflow">
			To combat this price barrier surrounding advanced prostheses, a
			modular prosthetic design can be developed to grow with the user. The
			modularity aspect of this project has not been found predominantly in
			the field yet and is the main innovation being targeted. No other
			prosthesis accommodates for growing children in this way. With 3D
			printing, a shape-changing prosthesis was created. Modular parts of
			the prosthesis will be added on by a prosthetist (a healthcare
			professional who fits prostheses) without needing to change the
			design. A dynamically changing prosthesis made utilizing pressure
			sensors, an airbag, and a pump, similar to a shape-changing cast, was
			also considered as an option (Shoshan & Shamaev, 2015). As an arm
			grows, it will create more pressure against the prosthesis. The pump
			will then change the airbag (underneath the prosthesis) size to
			accommodate for the increase in pressure. This airbag concept has
			been prototyped, however, it only expands and contracts for extra
			support when the prosthesis is in use. This novel socket design
			utilizes four spring-air pump systems located around the socket to
			change its size (Sang et al., 2014). This design will be expanded on
			to create a shape-changing prosthesis for growing children as its
			primary objective. Using a modular design for childhood prostheses
			can increase overall comfort and accumulate children to use
			prostheses for the rest of their lives. Currently, for competitor
			analysis, the closest conceptual design resembling the modularity
			being sought is hand attachments for prostheses and modularly
			designed prostheses software (Johannes, 2011). For example, consider
			a fin attachment for a prosthesis so that the user can swim better
			with it or an algorithm on a microprocessor that can be used for a
			multitude of prostheses. Therefore, there is essentially nothing in
			the field which can be compared to the modular design pursued in this
			project. <br> <br>Another important aspect of prostheses is
			the type of prosthesis. There are currently many different types of
			prostheses in the field, all utilizing different technologies or
			mechanics and targeting different patient groups. The most prevalent
			prosthesis types are passive, body powered, myoelectric, and hybrid
			(Smail et al., 2021). Passive prostheses are simply for aesthetics,
			have no functional ability, and are made of mostly silicone, plastic,
			and paint. Passive prostheses are also the cheapest type of
			prosthesis (Smail et al., 2021). Next, body powered prostheses have
			functional use, but have no electrical parts to them. Usually fitted
			with a shoulder harness and hook, body powered prostheses are the
			simplest and cheapest type of functional prostheses (Smail et al.,
			2021). Having been created more recently, myoelectric prostheses are
			more advanced than the body powered prostheses and require an
			external power source, usually a rechargeable battery. Utilizing
			electrodes connected to the muscles on the residual limb,
			myoelectrics take input from the electrodes and move the prosthetic
			limb with motors. Because of the batteries, electrodes, and motors,
			myoelectric prostheses are on the pricier side (Smail et al., 2021).
			Lastly, hybrid prostheses are a combination of both myoelectric and
			body powered prostheses. Hybrid prostheses have the harness of a body
			powered prosthesis with the electric motors and electrodes of a
			myoelectric. Because of this, a hybrid prosthesis’s price might range
			from a little more than a body powered prosthesis to more expensive
			than a myoelectric (Smail et al., 2021). Bidirectional signaling is
			also starting to be incorporated into myoelectrics. Sensors can be
			implemented into a myoelectric so that the user can receive some type
			of sensation when the prosthesis touches something. The myoelectric
			discussed in this paper will incorporate this functionality as well.
			This process is currently being improved by machine learning and
			artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the movements the user
			desires. <br> <br>There are three main ways to map out the
			mechanical control of a myoelectric prosthesis: sequential control
			(SeqCon), direct control (DirCon), and mapped control (MapCon) (Zhu
			et al., 2022). SeqCon utilizes “modes” within the prosthesis. When
			the user contracts a certain muscle, the prosthesis will move. When
			the user contracts a different muscle, the microprocessor on the
			myoelectric will switch modes on the prosthesis. Now, the original
			muscle contracted will control a different operation on the
			prosthesis. DirCon maps out certain prosthesis movements to specific
			muscle contractions (via the microprocessor code). Contraction of
			muscle x will control movement x and contraction of muscle y will
			control movement y. MapCon is similar to DirCon, but instead, the
			mappings are inverted. Contraction of muscle x will control movement
			y and contraction of muscle y will control movement x. The most
			common movements which myoelectrics mimic are open-close (Opn-Cls),
			pronation-supination (Pro-Sup), extend-flex (Ext-Flx), and
			radial-ulnar (Rad-Uln) movements (Zhu et al., 2022). SeqCon, compared
			to both DirCon and MapCon, is inferior because it is not as effective
			in multiple degree of function (DoF) situations (Zhu et al., 2022).
			This is why the project will focus on only DirCon and MapCon
			myoelectric control. <br> <br>A critical part in the
			creation of prosthesis is the material of the prosthesis. The main
			materials used to create prostheses are: silicone, carbon fiber,
			polymers, aluminum, and titanium (Mota, 2017). Silicone is mostly
			used for the liner of the prosthesis, separating the skin of the
			residual limb from the prosthesis, like how a sock separates a foot
			from a shoe. Carbon fiber can be used for almost all parts of the
			prosthesis. It can be used to create the fingers/hand as well as the
			socket for the residual limb. Its main advantages are that it is
			light and durable. However, carbon fiber is expensive and hard to 3D
			print. Polymers are used in the same fashion as carbon fiber as a
			cheaper alternative. Polymers are weaker and less durable compared to
			carbon fiber and can also be heavier. Aluminum and titanium, two
			similar metals, are used in creating some of the joints in a
			prosthesis. A high stress part, joints have to be made of strong
			materials, such as aluminum and titanium. Aluminum and titanium are
			used more in body powered prostheses because they are supported by
			shoulder harnesses and can handle the added weight. Hooks are usually
			made from those metals as well. <br> <br>Currently, a high
			percentage of amputees who receive prostheses abandon them and never
			use them again (Smail et al., 2021). This wastes the user's money and
			lowers their quality of living. The main cause of this is that
			prostheses are not comfortable to use or wear, due to irritation or
			pain. The main issues users find with their prostheses is that they
			are heavy, hot after an extended period of use, rigid, and bulky
			(Smail et al., 2021). In addition, users abandoned prostheses without
			sensory feedback, listing the lack of sensation as the cause of
			abandonment (Smail et al., 2021). Users who abandon prostheses feel
			like it is not a part of them and they could function better without
			it. This project will focus on improving these comfort-related
			prosthetic issues. <br> <br>To help implement the
			prosthesis design, Backyard Brains’s “The Claw” is utilized as proof
			of concept and guide. Backyard Brains is a company that creates
			neuroscience tools that utilize the human nervous system to control
			computers and robots. One of their products, named “The Claw,” will
			be used as the subject model in experimentation. The product comes
			with electrodes, an Arduino (microcontroller computer), and a plastic
			claw which can be controlled by the user (The Claw, n.d.). When the
			electrodes sense a muscle contract, they relay the EMG signal
			(electromyography signals, or electrical signals which the brain
			sends to muscles to control them) to the Arduino. The Arduino, coded
			in C++, then takes that signal to control a servo motor which rotates
			to move the plastic claw.

			Role of Student vs. Mentor<br> The work done by myself was all
			of the research, prototyping, testing, analysis, and scientific
			writing needed for the completion of this project. The work I had
			assistance with was the 3D printing of the parts of the prostheses
			and the assembly of some of the parts of the prostheses (assisted by
			Dr. Kevin Crowthers, Ph.D. and Mr. Pavel Loven). This project was
			completed over a six-month period. <br> <br> Equipment and
			Materials<br> The materials list is as follows. Backyard Brain’s
			The Claw Kit (software C++ in the Arduino IDE), Arduino kit (with
			various sensors, motors, and cables), Arduino power shield,
			Solidworks CAD modeling software, able-bodied human subject,
			clothespins, door with round doorknob, wooden blocks (the size of a
			Jenga piece), 3D printer (software Solidworks) with filament
			(different polymer types and carbon fiber), silicone liners,
			aluminum/titanium/copper wire, resistors, 9V batteries, photoelectric
			sensors, EMG sensors, vibration motors, servo motors, and
			transistors. <br> <br> General Testing Strategy<br>
			Prototypes of the prosthesis will be attached to “The Claw” to be
			tested. The Arduino code will also be modified to control the
			prosthetic prototype. The testing will be similar to the testing in
			“Myoelectric Control Performance of Two Degree of Freedom Hand-Wrist
			Prosthesis by Able-Bodied and Limb-Absent Subjects” (Zhu et al.,
			2022). The Arduino/Backyard Brain apparatus will be used to test each
			prosthetic prototype. The Arduino code will be adjusted as needed.
			For the prototype, different materials, movement mechanics, and
			modular approaches will be tested. The prototype will then be
			compared to the baseline performances of “The Claw” and of a normal
			human arm. Each of the five specific aims will be tested for. <br>
			<br> Technique 1 - Functionality Methodology<br> Test one
			will be a timed block stacking trial. The independent variable will
			be one of the following: material, Arduino code, movement mechanics,
			or modularity design. The dependent variable is the time it takes to
			stack the blocks. The controls will be each of the possible
			independent variables which were not selected for the specific trial.
			There will be three iterations of each prototype done. The second
			trial will be putting clothespins on a pole, given a two minute
			timer. The number of clothespins placed will be measured. The
			independent variable will be one of the following: material, Arduino
			code, movement mechanics, or modularity design. The dependent
			variable is the number of clothespins hung. The controls will be each
			of the possible independent variables which were not selected for the
			specific trial. There will be three iterations of each prototype
			done. The third trial will be opening and closing a door with a
			circular doorknob. This trial will test the DoF functionality of the
			prosthesis because it takes multiple muscle groups to twist the knob.
			There will be a two minute timer and the number of times the door is
			opened and closed will be measured. The independent variable will be
			one of the following: material, Arduino code, movement mechanics, or
			modularity design. The dependent variable is the number of times the
			door was opened and closed. The controls will be each of the possible
			independent variables which were not selected for the specific trial.
			There will be three iterations of each prototype done. <br> <br>
			Justification and Feasibility<br> The three trials to test for
			functionality are relevant because they all test different types of
			motor skills that a human arm would have. As mentioned before, these
			three trials have been inspired by “Myoelectric Control Performance
			of Two Degree of Freedom Hand-Wrist Prosthesis by Able-Bodied and
			Limb-Absent Subjects” (Zhu et al., 2022). <br> <br>
			Technique 2 - Modularity Methodology<br> To test and determine
			the quality of modularity in a prosthesis prototype, the model will
			need to be able to grow to various sizes while keeping its
			functionality. To test this, the functionality trials should be run
			again at each size which the prosthesis can be. <br> <br>
			Justification and Feasibility<br> It is quite straightforward to
			test the modularity of the prostheses and testing it in this fashion
			is relevant because it shows whether or not the prosthesis prototype
			can work for the child at each different size/age which the child
			needs the prosthesis for. <br> <br> Technique 3 -
			Durability Methodology<br> To test how durable the prosthesis
			is, two different material tests must be conducted. More
			specifically, a stress analysis on the software SolidWorks and an
			everyday degradation test. Various 3D printing materials will go
			through this testing; different polymers, materials, and infill
			(hollowness) levels will be tested. <br> <br> Justification
			and Feasibility<br> The two tests of stress testing and
			degradation testing are relevant because those two forces are the
			most likely to be put upon the prosthesis during use. If those two
			tests are satisfied by a prosthesis model, then that model will be
			durable when it is put through the usual forces of everyday use. <br>
			<br> Technique 4 - Comfort Methodology<br> To determine the
			levels of comfort for each prosthesis prototype, two tests will be
			conducted: rigidity and weight. Rigidity and weight are two of the
			leading contributors to prosthesis abandonment and if they are
			reduced, the prosthesis would become more comfortable for the user to
			wear. Each prototype will be weighed upon completion and the number
			of rigid points and edges will be counted on the CAD model. <br>
			<br> Justification and Feasibility<br> Weighing the
			prosthesis is the only way to get a quantifiable value for how heavy
			the prosthesis will be when worn by the user and is therefore
			justifiable. Because rigidity is not necessarily a quantifiable
			value, the number of points and edges is one of the best ways to
			portray this feature as a number. <br> <br> Technique 5 -
			Cost-effectiveness Methodology<br> To determine the cost
			effectiveness of each prosthesis prototype, the cost of all of the
			parts of the prototype will be aggregated. <br> <br>
			Justification and Feasibility<br> Quantifying the cost of each
			prototype is justifiable because lowering the cost of the final
			prototype would allow more children to access this product. The
			hardest part of this section would be to calculate the cost of the
			filament used to 3D print the prototype. <br> <br>
			Statistical Tests<br> To test for statistical significance, a
			standard t-test was used to compare two individual prototypes to each
			other or to the baseline/human arm. A standard t-test was used
			because it is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of
			exactly two groups. In addition, a one-way ANOVA (analysis of
			variance) test and poc host test were used to compare all prototypes
			to each other simultaneously (including the baseline and the normal
			human arm). A one-way ANOVA test is used to determine whether or not
			there is a statistically significant difference between the means of
			three or more independent groups. If an ANOVA produces a p-value that
			is less than the significance level, a post hoc test can be used to
			find out which groups differ from one another. These statistical
			tests were conducted for each category of data from the
			methodology/techniques of the specific aims. <br> <br>
			Ethics<br> There is little to no risk of harm when using The
			Claw from Backyard Brains in testing. There is not enough voltage to
			do any harm to the human testing the prosthesis. Some precautionary
			practices are to clean the area where the electrode will be placed on
			the skin and make sure the area is dry. It should be made sure that
			there is smooth contact between the electrode and the skin of the
			user.

	<h4 class="center">Analysis</h4>
	<p>
		Interpretation<br> Through the testing for the 5 specific aims,
		and analysis of the data, it can be confidently stated that the
		objectives for this project were achieved. A functional, modular,
		durable, comfortable, and cost-effective prosthesis was prototyped.
		There was statistical significance between the first and second
		prototypes as well as between the baseline and both prototypes (p<0.05
		for all cases). Through the design matrices, it can also be seen that
		the second prototype is the better of the two prototypes developed.
		Looking at the data more closely, it can be seen that the second
		prototype performs at 42% of the rate a normal human arm would
		(functionality-wise). The statistical tests also point to this
		conclusion. In the scope of the field of prostheses, this project
		introduces a new, modular type of myoelectric prosthesis with
		bidirectional signaling. It contains many parts of previous work in
		the field, like taking inspiration from the experiments by Zhu et al.
		in 2022. This research might influence more prostheses to become
		modular and thus appeal to children in need of them by reducing the
		cost of total prosthesis growing up. <br> <br> Limitations<br>
		Some limitations in this project was the quality of the 3D printing
		and quality of the Arduino parts. Only one type of filament for 3D
		printing was available at the time of printing, reducing the options
		for new prototypes. The quality of the Arduino attachments was also
		not advantageous because of their large size and faultiness at times.
		A challenge faced when producing the prototypes was the
		underestimation of the work that went into creating one. Only two
		prototypes were achieved because of this. In addition, the sensory
		feedback being external to the prototypes was a limitation. <br>
		<br> Future Research<br> Future work on this project will be
		geared toward implementing permanent electrode sensors/sensory
		feedback systems while continuing to improve upon the criteria. An
		overhaul of the sensory feedback system will lower the abandonment
		rate of the prosthesis, add to the control the user has over the
		prosthesis, and make the whole system a better overall experience. In
		addition, because of the 3D printing filament limitations, more
		materials, such as carbon fiber, should be implemented in the future.
		Carbon fiber or other materials could make the prosthesis lighter and
		easier to carry around all day for the user.
	</p>
	<h4 class="center">Conclusion</h4>
	<p>
		Objectives<br> Going into this endeavor the specific aims for the
		modular prosthesis were: functionality, modularity, durability,
		comfort, and cost-effectiveness.<br> A prosthesis lacking
		functionality has no use. There will be three main trials to test the
		functionality of the prosthesis. Elaborated more in the methodology
		section, the three main trials are stacking wooden blocks, hanging
		clothespins, and twisting a round doorknob with the prosthesis
		prototype.<br> Modularity is what will allow the prosthesis to
		grow up with the children. As the residual limb of the child grows, so
		too will the prosthesis. Modularity can be achieved in many different
		ways, a few of which are: modular plastic 3D-printed pieces that
		attach to each other, airbags and an air pump which will adjust the
		size of the prosthesis, or a combination of the two.<br> If the
		prosthesis is not durable, the user has to adjust their life to the
		prosthesis when it should be the other way around. This could
		ultimately lead to prosthesis abandonment, lowering the user’s quality
		of life. The user must be able to trust the prosthesis, and for that
		to happen it must be durable and sturdy. Many different types of
		3D-printing filaments at different infill levels will be tested in the
		creation of this prosthesis.<br> One of the leading reasons for
		prosthetic abandonment is comfort. The prosthesis cannot be too heavy,
		rigid, hot, or bulky. The material used and the overall mechanical
		design for the prosthesis will determine these factors. Again, many
		different types of 3D-printing filaments at different infill levels
		will be tested in the creation of this prosthesis.<br> Emphasized
		throughout this project, cost is one of the main hindrances of
		prostheses being widely available for both adults and children.
		Although the budget for this project is 2000 USD, the majority of that
		is not anticipated to be used. In addition, 2000 USD is only a
		fraction of the cost of current prostheses.<br> <br> Methods<br>
		To achieve these five specific aims, trials were created to test for
		each one. They were as follows.<br> Functionality — record the
		time it takes to stack 10 blocks, how many door open-closes in 2
		minutes, and how many clothespins hung in 2 minutes for the prototype<br>
		Modularity — test for functionality at different sizes of the
		prototype<br> Durability — stress analysis on Solidworks and
		everyday degradation of the prototype<br> Comfort — weight and
		rigid points on the design of the prototype<br>
		Cost-effectiveness — aggregate the costs of the prototype<br> <br>
		Results<br> The results of these tests for the baseline, human
		arm, and both prototypes are below.<br> Baseline — score of
		266/640 in the context of this project through the engineering design
		matrix<br> Human Arm — score of 550/640 in the context of this
		project through the engineering design matrix<br> Prototype 1 —
		score of 446/640 in the context of this project through the
		engineering design matrix<br> Prototype 2 — score of 464/640 in
		the context of this project through the engineering design matrix<br>
		Along with the engineering design matrix and the trials for the five
		specific aims, statistical tests were also conducted on and between
		the mean values for each of the functionality trials. A standard
		t-test was performed on the functionality trials between prototypes
		one and two. All three resulted in p-values less than 0.05. Trial 1
		(blocks) had a p-value of 0.02845, trial 2 (doors) had a p-value of
		0.01621, and trial 3 (clothespins) had a p-value of 0.00431. A one-way
		ANOVA test was performed on the functionality trials between all
		prototypes, baselines, and the human arm. All three resulted in
		p-values less than 0.05. Trial 1 (blocks) had a p-value of 0.00599,
		trial 2 (doors) had a p-value of 0.0000000265, and trial 3
		(clothespins) had a p-value of 0.000000017. These results give way for
		an additional statistic: the post hoc test.<br> A post hoc test
		was performed comparing the variance for the functionality trials
		between all prototypes, baselines, and the human arm. Trial 1 (blocks)
		had one p-value under 0.05: the baseline vs prototype 2 with a p-value
		of 0.046. Trial 2 (doors) had all p-values under 0.05. Trial 3
		(clothespins) had four p-values under 0.05: the baseline vs a human
		arm (0.001), the baseline vs prototype 1 (0.008), a human arm vs
		prototype 1 (0.001), and a human arm vs prototype 2 (0.001).<br>
		<br> Analysis<br> Through testing for the 5 specific aims
		and analyzing the data, it can be confidently stated that the
		objectives for this project were achieved. A functional, modular,
		durable, comfortable, and cost-effective prosthesis was prototyped.
		There was statistical significance between the first and second
		prototypes as well as between the baseline and both prototypes
		(p&lt;0.05 for all cases). Through the design matrices, the second
		prototype was determined to be the best. Further analysis of the
		functionality trials shows that the second prototype performs at 42%
		of the rate a normal human arm would. The statistical tests also point
		to this conclusion. <br> This project introduces a new, modular
		type of myoelectric prosthesis with bidirectional signaling. It
		contains many parts of previous work in the field, taking inspiration
		from the experiments by Zhu et al. in 2022. Some limitations were: the
		quality of the 3D printing, the quality of the Arduino attachments,
		underestimating the time it would take to design a prototype, and the
		external sensory feedback.<br> Future work will be implementing
		permanent electrode sensors/sensory feedback systems, continuing to
		improve upon the criteria, and trying new prosthesis materials, such
		as carbon fiber.<br> To conclude, a modular below-elbow
		prosthesis with bidirectional signaling is attainable and will allow
		children to grow up with and utilize prostheses better.
