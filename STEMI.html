	<p>Description: This course focuses on scientific research and
		engineering. During the first part of the year, students conduct
		independent research projects that incorporate reviewing literature,
		making conjectures, developing methodology, designing experiments, and
		communicating findings. Their final projects are presented at a
		school-wide science fair, with the possibility for advancement to
		regional, state, and international fairs. During the second part of
		the year, students work in small teams in order to engineer new
		products â€“ usually assistive technology devices. They meet with
		clients, conduct patent searches, design and build prototypes,
		demonstrate their products to expert judges, and deliver the products
		to their clients. Throughout the course, students practice
		incorporating purpose, clarity, organization, mechanics, and audience
		appeal as they communicate about topics in science and technology.
		Assignments consist of research papers, short essays, technical
		reports, and presentations. Students participate actively, as both
		writers and self-editors, and their works are consistently revised and
		often submitted for publication in online and print journals.</p>
