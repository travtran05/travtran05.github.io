	<p>Description: This course focuses on scientific research and
		engineering. During the first part of the year, students conduct
		independent research projects that incorporate reviewing literature,
		making conjectures, developing methodology, designing experiments, and
		communicating findings. Their final projects are presented at a
		school-wide science fair, with the possibility for advancement to
		regional, state, and international fairs. During the second part of
		the year, students work in small teams in order to engineer new
		products – usually assistive technology devices. They meet with
		clients, conduct patent searches, design and build prototypes,
		demonstrate their products to expert judges, and deliver the products
		to their clients. Throughout the course, students practice
		incorporating purpose, clarity, organization, mechanics, and audience
		appeal as they communicate about topics in science and technology.
		Assignments consist of research papers, short essays, technical
		reports, and presentations. Students participate actively, as both
		writers and self-editors, and their works are consistently revised and
		often submitted for publication in online and print journals.</p>

	<h4 class="center">Development of a Modular Below-Elbow Prosthesis
		with Bidirectional Signaling for Children</h4>
	<p>My project designed a modular prosthetic arm for children via 3D
		printing. The goal of my project was to reduce the cost of prostheses
		for children by creating a modular prototype which reduces the number
		of prostheses need during childhood. In addition to modularity, other
		focusing points of the project were: functionality, durability,
		comfort, and cost-effectiveness. The final product proved to be
		successful in testing.</p>

			Today, many prosthetic options are too expensive for the majority of
			individuals to obtain, causing a lowered quality of life for millions
			of amputees around the world. For children with a limb difference, it
			is even harder to obtain functional prostheses, as the child outgrows
			the limb too quickly, thus, new prostheses are needed every 12-18
			months. In order to combat the price barrier surrounding advanced
			prostheses, a modular myoelectric prosthesis model was created. The
			movement control of the myoelectric was implemented through an
			Arduino-microcontroller and powered by servo motors and photoelectric
			sensors by way of electrical signals emitted from muscles. The
			modular prototypes were developed with many different 3D-printed
			materials, infill levels, Arduino code, and movement mechanic
			designs, then tested on five specific criteria: functionality,
			modularity, durability, comfort, and cost effectiveness. Due to its
			modularity, the prosthesis will be more accessible to children who
			cannot afford to buy new ones. Additionally, bidirectional signaling
			between the prosthesis and the user was a major focus of this project
			so that the user would be able to feel simple sensations with the
			prosthesis. A cheaper, 3D-printed, and modular below-elbow
			myoelectric prosthesis will allow children to grow up with and
			utilize prostheses to a greater extent. The best prototype according
			to the criteria was selected via an engineering design matrix.
			Testing showed that the prototype performed at 42% the functionality
			of a human arm. Future work will be geared toward implementing
			permanent electrode sensors and continuing to improve upon the
			criteria. <br> <br> Keywords: <i>sensory feedback, 3D

			To combat this price barrier surrounding advanced prostheses, a
			modular prosthetic design can be developed to grow with the user. The
			modularity aspect of this project has not been found predominantly in
			the field yet and is the main innovation being targeted. No other
			prosthesis accommodates for growing children in this way. With 3D
			printing, a shape-changing prosthesis was created. Modular parts of
			the prosthesis will be added on by a prosthetist (a healthcare
			professional who fits prostheses) without needing to change the
			design. A dynamically changing prosthesis made utilizing pressure
			sensors, an airbag, and a pump, similar to a shape-changing cast, was
			also considered as an option (Shoshan & Shamaev, 2015). As an arm
			grows, it will create more pressure against the prosthesis. The pump
			will then change the airbag (underneath the prosthesis) size to
			accommodate for the increase in pressure. This airbag concept has
			been prototyped, however, it only expands and contracts for extra
			support when the prosthesis is in use. This novel socket design
			utilizes four spring-air pump systems located around the socket to
			change its size (Sang et al., 2014). This design will be expanded on
			to create a shape-changing prosthesis for growing children as its
			primary objective. Using a modular design for childhood prostheses
			can increase overall comfort and accumulate children to use
			prostheses for the rest of their lives. Currently, for competitor
			analysis, the closest conceptual design resembling the modularity
			being sought is hand attachments for prostheses and modularly
			designed prostheses software (Johannes, 2011). For example, consider
			a fin attachment for a prosthesis so that the user can swim better
			with it or an algorithm on a microprocessor that can be used for a
			multitude of prostheses. Therefore, there is essentially nothing in
			the field which can be compared to the modular design pursued in this
			project. <br> <br>Another important aspect of prostheses is
			the type of prosthesis. There are currently many different types of
			prostheses in the field, all utilizing different technologies or
			mechanics and targeting different patient groups. The most prevalent
			prosthesis types are passive, body powered, myoelectric, and hybrid
			(Smail et al., 2021). Passive prostheses are simply for aesthetics,
			have no functional ability, and are made of mostly silicone, plastic,
			and paint. Passive prostheses are also the cheapest type of
			prosthesis (Smail et al., 2021). Next, body powered prostheses have
			functional use, but have no electrical parts to them. Usually fitted
			with a shoulder harness and hook, body powered prostheses are the
			simplest and cheapest type of functional prostheses (Smail et al.,
			2021). Having been created more recently, myoelectric prostheses are
			more advanced than the body powered prostheses and require an
			external power source, usually a rechargeable battery. Utilizing
			electrodes connected to the muscles on the residual limb,
			myoelectrics take input from the electrodes and move the prosthetic
			limb with motors. Because of the batteries, electrodes, and motors,
			myoelectric prostheses are on the pricier side (Smail et al., 2021).
			Lastly, hybrid prostheses are a combination of both myoelectric and
			body powered prostheses. Hybrid prostheses have the harness of a body
			powered prosthesis with the electric motors and electrodes of a
			myoelectric. Because of this, a hybrid prosthesis’s price might range
			from a little more than a body powered prosthesis to more expensive
			than a myoelectric (Smail et al., 2021). Bidirectional signaling is
			also starting to be incorporated into myoelectrics. Sensors can be
			implemented into a myoelectric so that the user can receive some type
			of sensation when the prosthesis touches something. The myoelectric
			discussed in this paper will incorporate this functionality as well.
			This process is currently being improved by machine learning and
			artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the movements the user
			desires. <br> <br>There are three main ways to map out the
			mechanical control of a myoelectric prosthesis: sequential control
			(SeqCon), direct control (DirCon), and mapped control (MapCon) (Zhu
			et al., 2022). SeqCon utilizes “modes” within the prosthesis. When
			the user contracts a certain muscle, the prosthesis will move. When
			the user contracts a different muscle, the microprocessor on the
			myoelectric will switch modes on the prosthesis. Now, the original
			muscle contracted will control a different operation on the
			prosthesis. DirCon maps out certain prosthesis movements to specific
			muscle contractions (via the microprocessor code). Contraction of
			muscle x will control movement x and contraction of muscle y will
			control movement y. MapCon is similar to DirCon, but instead, the
			mappings are inverted. Contraction of muscle x will control movement
			y and contraction of muscle y will control movement x. The most
			common movements which myoelectrics mimic are open-close (Opn-Cls),
			pronation-supination (Pro-Sup), extend-flex (Ext-Flx), and
			radial-ulnar (Rad-Uln) movements (Zhu et al., 2022). SeqCon, compared
			to both DirCon and MapCon, is inferior because it is not as effective
			in multiple degree of function (DoF) situations (Zhu et al., 2022).
			This is why the project will focus on only DirCon and MapCon
			myoelectric control. <br> <br>A critical part in the
			creation of prosthesis is the material of the prosthesis. The main
			materials used to create prostheses are: silicone, carbon fiber,
			polymers, aluminum, and titanium (Mota, 2017). Silicone is mostly
			used for the liner of the prosthesis, separating the skin of the
			residual limb from the prosthesis, like how a sock separates a foot
			from a shoe. Carbon fiber can be used for almost all parts of the
			prosthesis. It can be used to create the fingers/hand as well as the
			socket for the residual limb. Its main advantages are that it is
			light and durable. However, carbon fiber is expensive and hard to 3D
			print. Polymers are used in the same fashion as carbon fiber as a
			cheaper alternative. Polymers are weaker and less durable compared to
			carbon fiber and can also be heavier. Aluminum and titanium, two
			similar metals, are used in creating some of the joints in a
			prosthesis. A high stress part, joints have to be made of strong
			materials, such as aluminum and titanium. Aluminum and titanium are
			used more in body powered prostheses because they are supported by
			shoulder harnesses and can handle the added weight. Hooks are usually
			made from those metals as well. <br> <br>Currently, a high
			percentage of amputees who receive prostheses abandon them and never
			use them again (Smail et al., 2021). This wastes the user's money and
			lowers their quality of living. The main cause of this is that
			prostheses are not comfortable to use or wear, due to irritation or
			pain. The main issues users find with their prostheses is that they
			are heavy, hot after an extended period of use, rigid, and bulky
			(Smail et al., 2021). In addition, users abandoned prostheses without
			sensory feedback, listing the lack of sensation as the cause of
			abandonment (Smail et al., 2021). Users who abandon prostheses feel
			like it is not a part of them and they could function better without
			it. This project will focus on improving these comfort-related
			prosthetic issues. <br> <br>To help implement the
			prosthesis design, Backyard Brains’s “The Claw” is utilized as proof
			of concept and guide. Backyard Brains is a company that creates
			neuroscience tools that utilize the human nervous system to control
			computers and robots. One of their products, named “The Claw,” will
			be used as the subject model in experimentation. The product comes
			with electrodes, an Arduino (microcontroller computer), and a plastic
			claw which can be controlled by the user (The Claw, n.d.). When the
			electrodes sense a muscle contract, they relay the EMG signal
			(electromyography signals, or electrical signals which the brain
			sends to muscles to control them) to the Arduino. The Arduino, coded
			in C++, then takes that signal to control a servo motor which rotates
			to move the plastic claw.
