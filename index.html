		Hello, my name is Travis Tran, and I am currently a junior at the
		Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI (<a
			href="https://www.massacademy.org/">MAMS</a>). Before MAMS, my
		sending school was the Advanced Math and Science Academy (<a
			href="https://www.amsacs.org/">AMSA</a>), a charter school located in
		Marlboro. I have lived in Marlboro my entire life with my brother, my
		mom, my dad, and my husky, Kirby. I was born here in MA, but both of
		my parents are Vietnamese and immigrated here due to the Vietnam War.
		That has always been one of the reasons why I strive to achieve and
		maintain high academic standards for myself. Hearing the stories of my
		father working three jobs and going to college at the same time while
		being alone in a foreign country motivates me to make him proud. I
		consider myself to be a hard-working, perseverant, easy-going, and
		curious scholar. These qualities have led me to seek a higher
		education experience at MAMS and later on at university.

		Outside of traditional school, I enjoy hanging out with my friends,
		going to the gym, playing video games, skiing/snowboarding, playing
		with my dog, and following the Boston sports teams. I am a huge
		Patriots and Celtics fan and enjoy going to games. I follow the NFL
		and NBA a lot and do fantasy leagues with my friends.<br> <br>In
		the summer of 2022, I spent two weeks taking a bioinformatics course
		at <a
			href="https://summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/pre-college-program/">Harvard
			University</a>. I slept in the dorms there and had an incredible
		experience meeting and learning with people from around the world. In
		the future, I hope to do another program like this, or maybe an
		internship, to continue to learn new things, meet new people, and come
		across new experiences. Similar to the reasons I spent two weeks at
		Harvard, I enjoy traveling the world and I am extremely grateful that
		I am able to with my family. I enjoy going to other places and
		experiencing new cultures, new adventures, new people, and the great
		things that this world has to offer.

		I have also done a lot of community service through clubs at AMSA and
		have received awards for doing so. I really enjoy giving back to the
		community and it gives me a feeling that nothing else can. One
		Thanksgiving, I made a Turkey in the morning for a food shelter and
		the smiles on the people’s faces were amazing to see. This enjoyment
		of community service prompted me to apply and qualify for AMSA’s
		National Honor Society (<a href="https://www.nhs.us/">NHS</a>)
		chapter. Here at MAMS, I have participated in STEM Saturdays where I
		help to teach STEM topics to elementary and middle school students in
		the Worcester area. In addition, I have taught lessons on reflection
		angles using mirrors to elementary and middle school students at
		Tatnuck Magnet School and the Nativity School of Worcester during
		MAMS's community service day.<br> <br>At AMSA, I also
		participated in student government and math team, earning multiple
		rewards in that regard. During my time on the AMSA math team, I was
		elected captain as a sophomore and qualified for the Junior
		Mathematical Olympiad (<a
			href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/usamo-united-states-of-america-mathematical-olympiad">JMO</a>).
		I was also AMSA’s leading scorer both years I was a part of the high
		school team, competing in the Worcester County Mathematics League (<a
			href="https://www.wocomal.org/">WOCOMAL</a>). As a member of student
		government, I helped to organize school-wide events like homecoming
		and communicated the student body’s needs to the administration. All
		in all, I was an active and engaged part of the community. Here at
		MAMS, I am a part of its math team, programming team, logic club,
		creative engineering club, and computer aided design (CAD) club.
