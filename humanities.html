		Description: This course uses a variety of literary, historical, and
		cultural readings in combination with essay writing, group projects,
		and class discussions to answer the essential question: “What does it
		mean to be human?” Students will examine how the definitions and
		understandings of “humanity” have changed over time. <br> <br>

		This humanities class is unlike any I have taken before. I have really
		enjoyed it because of the discussion based nature of the class and the
		ample time to work on essays. We spend most of the time discussing
		taboo topics in an open and respectful way and I really value that.
		Some of the pieces I have worked on both alone and with a group are
		below.

	<h4 class="center">Thoreau Skit</h4>

	<p>
		The Thoreau Skit was a group play performed by myself, <a
			href="https://www.acsl.org/">Anya Kelley</a>, <a
			href="https://www.acsl.org/">Joseph Yu</a>, <a
			href="https://www.acsl.org/">Mihika Chalasani</a>, and <a
			href="https://www.acsl.org/">Giang Pham</a> for our all-school
		retreat to Camp Bournedale at the beginning of the school year to
		explore different interpretations of our summer reading book: <i>Walden</i>
		by Henry David Thoreau. Through the play, our group demonstrated that
		Thoreau wrote <i>Walden</i> to show that people use hypocrisy as a
		coping mechanism. The production and the performance of the play was a
		really fun process and was a great way to get to know my new
		classmates.

	<h4 class="center">Why go to School?</h4>
	<p>This essay on education poses the question of whether or not
		school is needed in this day and age, as the internet gives everyone
		access to the vast library of human knowledge almost instantly. I
		argue that education is needed because it teaches students not only
		facts that are available on the internet, but teaches critical
		thinking and character as well.</p>
