		Description: This course goes beyond the traditional high school
		mathematics curriculum by engaging students in open-ended problem
		solving, computer simulations, and collaborative work. Students use a
		mathematical approach to model real-world situations through the
		application of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and statistics. <br>
		<br> This math course is unique to me because it is very
		interactive and geared toward student conversation rather than teacher
		lectures. Almost every class starts off with going over the homework
		with your tablemates and gets the ball rolling in a good way. The
		problems which are solved in class require outside of the box thinking
		and are similar to olympiad style questions. Currently, I am on the
		advanced mathematics track at MAMS and am taking Calculus III and IV
		at WPI. Some of my group projects are below.

		The High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (<a
			href="https://www.comap.com/contests/himcm-midmcm">HiMCM</a>) is an
		international contest designed to provide high school and middle
		school level students with the opportunity to work as team members to
		engage and improve their modeling, problem solving, and writing
		skills. Here at MAMS, we (<a

		into the night and slept over for three days to complete the 2022
		modeling problem. Although it was hard and tiring, it was really
		satisfying at the end to submit our solution. We chose to pick problem
		B because we felt that it contained more data to supplement our
		models to the solution of the problem. The general method of our
		solution was to regress the data points in various ways to get
		different graphs to predict future data.

	<h4 class="center">Epsilon School</h4>

	<p>
		The Epsilon School problem was a mathematical modeling problem in
		which my group (<a
			href="https://users.wpi.edu/~lpattison1/index.html">Lily Pattison</a>, <a
			href="https://users.wpi.edu/~ewang1/index.html">Emily Wang</a>, and I) had to hire new teachers to the Epsilon School because
		a new wing is being added. The student population will be increased
		from 490 to 630 for the next school year. In total, seven additional
		faculty will be hired. Given student enrollments for the past two
		years, should every major discipline (English, Social Studies,
		Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Foreign Language) each
		receive one new teacher, or does the demand for courses argue that
		some departments should receive two new teachers while others receive
		none? My group decided to go with the latter.
