		Description: This course begins with web design techniques and
		implementation. Students are responsible for designing, developing,
		and maintaining their own personal and professional electronic
		portfolio in the form of a website. The fundamental concepts of
		object-oriented programming and methodologies are explored. Students
		develop computational thinking and problem-solving skills through
		programming practices and learn how to write and analyze software
		programs. Mobile application technologies are encountered. Students
		apply the software engineering lifecycle model to help develop
		applications that benefit the community.<br> <br> Having
		already taken AP Computer Science A, I have been on a more advanced CS
		track here at MAMS, working on complex programs and a partnered
		research project. Below are some of the projects I have worked on.

	<h4 class="center">Agram</h4>



	<p>
		Agram is an American Computer Science (<a href="https://www.acsl.org/">ACSL</a>)
		programming problem of Senior Division Contest #1 in the 2016-2017
		academic year. The problem is to develop a a program to play the game
		Agram. Agram is a card game for 2 players, using the cards from a
		standard 52-card pack. The dealer deals five cards to each player. The
		opponent player leads any card, playing it face up. The program will
		determine what card the dealer will play. Here are the rules of the
		game:<br> <br> — The dealer must play a card of the same
		suit if they can. <br> <br>— The dealer plays the lowest
		card in the suit that is of a higher rank than the card the opponent
		played.<br> <br>— If the dealer does not have such a card,
		they play their lowest card in that suit.<br> <br>— If the
		dealer does not have a card in that suit, they play the lowest ranking
		card regardless of suit.<br> <br>— If there is a tie, they
		play the card in the following order: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and
		spades. <br> <br> There will be 5 lines of input. Each line
		will contain the opponent’s lead card and the 5 cards held by the
		dealer. All cards will be represented by 2-character strings in
		value-suit order. AH represents the ace of hearts. K, Q and J and T
		will be used for king, queen, jack and 10 respectively. Note that the
		ace in this game has the lowest rank. For each input line, print the
		card the dealer must play.

	<h4 class="center">ML Model for March Madness</h4>

	<p>
		One of the most unpredictable events in the modern era is the NCAA
		Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, commonly known as March
		Madness. With 68 teams competing and 67 games played, there are 2^67
		possible bracket combinations. That is a number comparable to the
		number of grains of sand on the Earth. In addition, upsets are
		extremely common. All four number one seeds have made it to the Final
		Four only five times out of the 82 years the tournament has taken
		place. <a

			Vuppala</a> and I want to create a machine learning algorithm that can
		predict each match with a high probability, with the ultimate goal of
		getting every match prediction right. <br> <br> Starting
		with sourced code from <a
			href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/March-Madness-ML">GitHub</a>
		(which utilizes gradient boosted regression), we improved on the
		process by printing out a visualized version of the bracket instead of
		percentages to win. We only modified the model itself and not the
		preprocessing. In addition, we are currently working on our own ML
		model to try to predict the bracket better than the gradient boosted
		regression model we improved on.
