		Description: These collaborative immersion courses focus on acquiring
		language proficiency through the use of authentic materials, including
		literature, music, film, discussions, and games. Students understand
		grammar in meaningful contexts and engage in project-based learning as
		they produce podcasts, make movies, and engage in small group
		projects. Students are assessed on their individual progress via
		video, audio, and written portfolios. <br> <br> This Spanish
		class is very unique to me because it is immersive and challenges me
		to go out of my comfort zone every class. Participation is a large
		part of the course and I feel like I am learning more Spanish by being
		forced to use it. This class is also very fun with lots of group work,
		projects, and movies.

		— Date of Birth. <br> <br> — Style. <br> <br> —
		Origin. <br> <br> — 3 different examples of artist’s work. <br>
		<br> — Described colors. <br> <br> — Described objects

	<h4 class="center">Spanish Memes</h4>

	<p>
		The Spanish Memes project practices formulating sentences in Spanish
		with a little fun added into it. All memes were put into a competition
		and winners were displayed on bulletin boards. Translated, these memes
		mean:<br> <br> — First I will do math homework. Then I will
		do physics homework. Finally, I will do STEM homework. Finally, I will
		do STEM homework. <br> <br> — Corporate needs you to find
		the differences between this picture and this picture. They are the
		same picture.<br> <br> — Dr. C. correcting homework at half
		past one at night.<br> <br> — The world if everyone speaks
		two languages.
