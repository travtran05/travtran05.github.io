		Description: This course takes an algebra and calculus-based approach
		to investigate and model connections between concepts, equations, and
		graphs. Through classroom discussions and collaborative work, students
		learn about mechanics, gravitation, electricity, magnetism, waves, and
		harmonic oscillations. They design, build, and debug their own
		experiments and lab apparatuses. They analyze their data using
		statistical methods and report their findings via journal-formatted
		printouts, poster boards, and slideshow presentations. <br> <br>

		Although hard to conceptualize at first, physics at MAMS has been
		really engaging and exciting for me to learn. Everything unit builds
		of off the previous one and gives a physical meaning to the
		mathematical formulas learned in the math classes of years past.
		Predicting the movement of a projectile or the mass of an unknown
		object through indirect means has interested me in this class. Some of
		my labs are below.

	<h4 class="center">Quantifying Motion</h4>


	<p>In this lab, I observed the motion of a battery operated car and
		a cart traveling down a low friction incline. I collected my data
		using a stop watch and tape measure to determine if the vehicle was
		moving at constant velocity or accelerating. If it was in motion or
		accelerating, I found the value at which it was moving or
		accelerating.</p>

	<h4 class="center">Surface Area vs. Friction</h4>

	<p>In this lab, I had to determine if the surface area of an object
		affects its coefficients of friction between a common surface. I did
		this by testing for both the static and kinetic coefficients of a
		tissue box (testing the different sides) on a piece of wood. Through
		my experimentation, I confirmed my hypothesis and concluded that
		surface area does not effect the coefficients of friction.</p>
